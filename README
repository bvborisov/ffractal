FFractal is a IFS generator, capable of creating linear and non-linear(a.k.a fractal flames) systems. It has a straightforward UI and is written in java. In this repository you can find an executable .jar file called ffractal.jar and all the source files for the project. I have also included eclipse files, should you wish to import the project and modify/use it.
Below you can find a quick tutorial of how to use the package. For more information on fractal flames, read <a href="http://flam3.com/flame.pdf" target="_"> this </a>.
HOW TO USE THIS SOFTWARE:
1. Download the ffractal.jar file to your system.
2. Execute from command line/shell in the same directory : java -jar ffractal.jar

4. Input any number of functions (say 15)

6. Pick a variation (say handkerchief)
7. From the 'rendering actions' tab click (in this order) 'set color provider type' and chose the default 'Basic'. Then click on 'compute points' and pick '1500000' ( for example). Finally click on 'render points'. Should you wish to rearange or delete some actions, click on them in the list below and use the arrows/press the delete key (the same applies for functions in the left panel).
8. In the panel 'space' click 'best'
9. In the 'output' section, make the dimensions 2,000 x 2,000 (for example) and pick a file destination of your liking(can be ommited).
